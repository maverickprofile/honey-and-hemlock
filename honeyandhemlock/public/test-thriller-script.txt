A Thriller Short Film
Written by Test Author

FADE IN:

INT. ABANDONED RADIO STATION - NIGHT

A dusty control room filled with vintage broadcasting equipment. Moonlight streams through broken windows. SARAH CHEN (30s, tech specialist) frantically works on an old transmitter, sparks flying as she connects wires.

SARAH
(whispering to herself)
Come on... just one more connection...

A LOUD BANG echoes from somewhere in the building. Sarah freezes, listening. Footsteps approach slowly down the hallway.

SARAH (CONT'D)
(into radio mic)
If anyone can hear this, I'm at the old KQRX station. They're coming for me. The evidence is hidden in frequency 88.3. Don't let them—

The door CRASHES open. A SHADOWY FIGURE stands silhouetted in the doorway, face obscured.

FIGURE
You should have stayed quiet, Sarah.

Sarah's hand slowly reaches for a heavy microphone stand.

SARAH
The world deserves to know what you did.

FIGURE
The world doesn't care about truth anymore. Only survival.

The Figure steps forward into the moonlight, revealing a GOVERNMENT BADGE on their jacket.

SARAH
How many more have to disappear before someone stops you?

FIGURE
As many as it takes.

Sarah suddenly SWINGS the microphone stand. The Figure dodges, pulling out a weapon.

SARAH
(shouting into still-live mic)
THE COORDINATES ARE 34.0522 NORTH—

A DART hits Sarah's neck. She staggers, vision blurring.

FIGURE
No one's listening, Sarah. We control all the frequencies now.

Sarah collapses to her knees, fighting to stay conscious. She manages to flip one final switch on the console.

SARAH
(weakly)
Not... all of them...

A RED LIGHT begins blinking on an old emergency broadcast transmitter. The Figure's eyes widen in realization.

FIGURE
(into earpiece)
We have a problem. She activated the emergency beacon.

Sarah smiles weakly as she loses consciousness.

SARAH
(barely audible)
Someone's always... listening...

The Figure rushes to the console, frantically trying to shut down the transmission. On the screen: "EMERGENCY BROADCAST - UPLOADING 47%"

FIGURE
(panicked, into earpiece)
I need a full spectrum jamming, NOW! 
(pause)
What do you mean it's on a protected frequency?

The upload bar continues: 73%... 85%... 91%...

EXT. CITY SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

Across the city, old emergency radios in homes, cars, and stores suddenly come to life with static.

SARAH'S VOICE
(through radios, recorded)
My name is Sarah Chen. If you're hearing this, I'm probably already gone. But the truth about Project Silent Wave must be exposed...

INT. ABANDONED RADIO STATION - CONTINUOUS

The Figure stands over Sarah's unconscious body, speaking urgently into the earpiece as the upload completes.

FIGURE
Contain this. Whatever it takes.
(pause)
Yes, sir. Full media blackout protocol.

The Figure looks down at Sarah, then at the blinking red light.

FIGURE (CONT'D)
(to Sarah's unconscious form)
You have no idea what you've just unleashed.

Suddenly, Sarah's eyes snap open, revealing she was playing unconscious. She holds up a small device - a DEAD MAN'S SWITCH.

SARAH
(smiling)
Neither do you.

She releases the switch.

BLACKOUT.

The sound of MULTIPLE EXPLOSIONS in the distance.
